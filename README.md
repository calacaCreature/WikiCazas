My goal with this website is to turn it into a small Wikipedia of military aircraft that I find interesting, in which I will also include other aircraft for military or police use that I request and from which you can find truthful information.
Also, I'm using the style of this website to inspire long-term wiki building, although in the current state of the page it has no similarities:
